# Flynn Elementary Lunch Menu

If you've ever tried to check the school lunch menu, you know its kind of a pain in the butt.

This is a small website that fetches the lunch menu for the week and neatly plops it on the screen.

Builds as a docker container that can be deployed to google cloud run easily.
